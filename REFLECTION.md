# Code Review and Reflection
Author: Sanya Parvej  
Assignment: City of Winnipeg Lane Closures (Assignment 5)  
Course Objective: To integrate City of Winnipegâ€™s Open Data API and demonstrate asynchronous JavaScript, JSON parsing, and DOM manipulation.

## Overview
For this assignment, I built a web app that lets users search for lane and street closures in Winnipeg using the City of Winnipeg Open Data API.  
You can type in a street name, click Search, and see a table of closures showing details like cross streets, start and end dates, and traffic effects.  

It was my first time working directly with live API data.

## Code Review
Before submitting, I went through all my files to make sure the code was neat, consistent, and easy to read.  
Here are some specific things I focused on:
- Consistent Formatting: I ensured proper indentation, spacing, and line breaks throughout the code for better readability.
- Meaningful Naming: I used clear and descriptive names for variables and functions to make their purpose obvious.
- Comments: I added comments to explain complex logic and the purpose of functions, which helps anyone reading the code understand it quickly.
- Error Handling: I included error handling for API requests to manage potential issues gracefully.
